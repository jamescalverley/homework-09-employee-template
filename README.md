## Project Title
Homework-10-Employee Template Generator 

## Project Description
This the intent of this homework assignment aws to build a command line application that will create an html page that displays the information for all team members within the team. 

The html must display the following the information for each team member:

Manager: 
    - ID
    - Name
    - Role
    - Email
    - Office Number

Engineer(s):
    - ID
    - Name
    - Role
    - Email
    - Git Hub Username

Intern(s):
    - ID
    - Name
    - Role
    - Email
    - School Attended

Through the command line, the user is prompted to provide the required information for at least one manager. From there, they are then prompted to build the team by adding any number of engineers and interns. For each type of employee, the user is prompted to input the required information for each type. 

Once all team members and information has been added, an html card is created for each member which is appended to a main html file. 

## Next Steps
Currently there is no way for the user to save the team they have created. In the future the app should be able to save all the team information to a database to be accessed later.
